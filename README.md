**Question 1:** 

Rohan and Raju have a candy where each square has a number. Rohan wants to find out how many ways she can break the bar into a contiguous segment such that:

###### Inputs:

- An array of integers.

- An integer k.

###### Output:

- The number of valid (i, j) pairs.

###### Example:

arr = [1, 3, 2, 6, 1, 2]
