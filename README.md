## DSA

**Question 1:** 

Rohan and Raju have a candy where each square has a number. Rohan wants to find out how many ways she can break the bar into a contiguous segment such that:

1. The segment length matches Raju's birth month.
2. The sum of the numbers in the segment equals Raju's birth day.
##### Inputs:

- An array of integers representing the chocolate squares.

Candy = [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]

day = 4

month = 2

##### Output: 2

**Question 2:** 

Given an array of integers and an integer k, determine the number of (i, j) pairs where i \< j and the sum of the pair is divisible by k.

###### Inputs:

- An array of integers.

- An integer k.

###### Output:

- The number of valid (i, j) pairs.

###### Example:

arr = [1, 3, 2, 6, 1, 2]

k = 3
