# Hello Everyone,

We are excited to announce that the **"21 Days of Code"** event is starting today at **12 PM**! This is a fantastic opportunity to hone your coding skills and collaborate with fellow participants. Here's how it will work:

## Event Start:
- The first question will be posted today at **12 PM**.
- Each day, a new question will be provided at the same time in the `README` of the GitHub repository.

## Repository Setup:

1. **Fork the Repository:** 
   - Today, after the question is posted, everyone must fork the given GitHub repository.
   
2. **Create Your Folder:**
   - Inside your forked repository, create a folder with your name.
   
3. **Add Your Name File:**
   - Inside your folder, add a `[your name].md` file.

## Rules and Tips:

- **Edit Only Your Files:**
  - Please ensure you only edit your own folder and files. Do not make changes to other participants' codes and files.

- **Web Development:**
  - try to use semantic tags instead of relying solely on div elements.

- **Commit Deadlines:**
  - Ensure your commits for each day's question are made before **12 PM** the next day. Only commits made before this deadline will be accepted.

## Doubts and Queries:
If you have any doubts regarding GitHub or the event, feel free to message in the group before the event starts.

Looking forward to seeing your amazing contributions. Happy coding!

Best regards,  
**Technical Heads,**
