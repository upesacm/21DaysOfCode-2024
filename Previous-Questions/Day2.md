## DSA


#### Question 1: A professor has a class of students and wants to know if the class should be cancelled based on student arrival times. The class is cancelled if fewer than a threshold number of students arrive on time.
##### Inputs:
- An integer representing the threshold number of students.
- An array of integers representing arrival times, where a non-positive integer indicates on-time arrival.
Output:
- YES" if the class is cancelled, "NO" otherwise.
##### Example:

threshold = 3

arrival_times = [-1, -3, 4, 2]

Output: YES

##### Question 2: A player is climbing a leaderboard where scores are ranked in descending order. Given the scores on the leaderboard and the player's scores in the game, determine the player's rank after each new score.
Inputs:
- An array of integers representing the leaderboard scores.
-	An array of integers representing the player's scores.
Output:
-	An array of integers representing the player's rank after each new score.

Example:

leaderboard = [100, 90, 90, 80]

player_scores = [70, 80, 105]

Output: [4, 3, 1]
