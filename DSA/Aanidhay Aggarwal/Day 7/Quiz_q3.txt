You want to buy p properties on an infinite 1-dimensional road where on each position, 
there will either be a police station or a property.

You are also given an integer array station of size n which shows the positions of the police stations 
on the road. Each station[i] is distinct and its position can also be negative.

The price of a property on the road is the distance of the property from its nearest police station. 
Distance is the absolute difference between the position of nearest police station and the property

(i.e. cost = |Position nearest_police_station - Positionproperty|)

You have to return the minimum amount that is required to buy exactly p properties.

Input Format

Input:
n = 2
station = {6,8}
p=5
Output: 7
Explanation: You have to buy the properties at positions 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10. 
The total cost of buying these properties is |6-4| + |6-5| + 18-71 + |8-9| + |8-10| = 7, 
which is the minimum amount required to buy 5 properties.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5
-108 <= station[i] <= 10^8
1 <= p <= 10^8
Each station[i] is distinct.

Output Format

Input:
n = 2
station â€” {-1,8}
p= 4
Output:4
Explanation: You have to buy the properties at positions -2, 0, 7 and 9 and 
the amount of buying these properties is |(-1)-(-2)|+|(-1)-0|+|8-7|+|8-9| = 4, 
which is the minimum amount required to buy 4 properties.
