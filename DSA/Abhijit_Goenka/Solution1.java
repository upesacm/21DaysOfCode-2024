/*
 Rohan and Raju have a candy where each square has a number. Rohan wants to find out how many ways she can break the bar into a contiguous segment such that:

The segment length matches Raju's birth month.
The sum of the numbers in the segment equals Raju's birth day.
Inputs:
An array of integers representing the chocolate squares.

Two integers representing Raju's birth day and birth month.

Output:
The number of valid ways to divide the bar.
Example:
Candy = [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]

day = 4

month = 2

Output: 2
